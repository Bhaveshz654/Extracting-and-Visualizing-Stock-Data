# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. 

In this project, we have extracted financial data like historical share prices and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping on popular stocks. The stocks we have worked with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.
In this project, I have used the  y-finance API to obtain the stock ticker and extract information about the stock. Based on this I have answered then asked questions about the results.
